# Hosted materials

This is a space for collecting resources (e.g. slides) to be linked as [Conference Materials](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020program#conference-materials), in case they are not already available online.

We recommend using a naming scheme like `speaker-short-title...`, e.g. `porreca-rTRhexNG-shiny-app.pdf`.

Resources uploaded here can be linked in the main [README.md](../README.md) as e.g. `[slides](materials/porreca-rTRhexNG-shiny-app.pdf)`.
